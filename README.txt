I am a chatty chess program, using blog methodoly to play a game of chess, 
dicuss position, openings or playing techniques. The key difference between
me and other,more powerful, computer opponents is that I can explain my moves
even if they are bad!

Hopefully we can both learn from this!

In my current form I am a command-line based program... to play me you need
to get out a board play you move and tell me what you have played. I will
tell you what I have played and why. We can chat about chess and I will use
my extensive reading to give you some ideas about chess.

To start my discussion about the game I have my own approach. I analyse a 
position through a piece-centric approach. In this approach pieces will talk
to me, telling me (for example) if they are attacked, unprotected. They also
recognise if they have duties which currently restrict their mobility and 
look for fellow pieces who they are co-ordination with. Empty squares have 
a similar structure, so they can tell me who controls them and whether they
consider themselves of tactical or strategic importance.

To give me other chess things to talk about I have read many chess books and
analysed many games from great players. I also take advise from more
traditional chess programs, but I limit this to make sure you are playing me,
not them. When playing I might ask my "silicon friend" to analyse a move on
my 'candidate list' but will not play a move unless I have thought of it
myself. Please trust me on this: I trust you!

These are my dreams... but I am a work in progress. How am I doing?
